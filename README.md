### Rules for Key-value Pairs

    - No period at the end
    - Infinitive verbs
  - Examples: 
    - YES: `"summary": "Get Auth Token"`
    - NO: `"summary": "Get Auth Token."`
    - NO: `"summary": "Get auth token."`
    - NO: `"summary": "Gets an Auth Token"`

    - NO: `"description": "Return an authentication token."`
    - NO: `"description": "Returns an authentication token"`

- Operation IDs:
  - Rules:
    - Concatenate all the words in the path, minus special characters
  - Example:
    ```
    "/sandbox/item/set_verification_status": {
      "operationId": "sandboxItemSetVerificationStatus"`
    }
    ```

### Other Rules

## Miscellaneous Tips

Keep the following suggestions in mind, where possible, in order to maintain consistency.

- [Prefer English to Latin](https://developers.google.com/style/abbreviations?hl=en#dont-use)
    - Use 'for example' rather than 'e.g.', where possible.
- Never start a sentence with code
  - Examples:
    - YES: "The `user_id` is required."
    - NO: "`user_id` is required."
- Referencing endpoints in plain text:
  - Include the leading slash
      - Examples: 
        - YES: "Send a POST request to the `/payment/list.json` endpoint."
        - NO: "Send a request to `payment/list.json`."
- Capitalization:
  - Rules:
    - Capitalize proper nouns
    - Capitalize parameter names, endpoint names, or when referencing a specific object/entity.
    - Be wary of the temptation to over-capitalize. Nouns start to feel more proper when you're referring to them again and again.
  - Examples: 
    - YES: The Application allows you to...
    - YES: The Application ID is required.
    - YES: The Scopes object includes...
    - NO: You can use scopes to allow the user to...
    - NO: The Application allows you to...
- Use [semantic line breaks](https://sembr.org/).
- Period in list items:
  - Unordered lists: no period
  - Ordered lists: period


NOTES:
- user ID not User ID
